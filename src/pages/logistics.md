## Collaboration Policy
Collaboration is encouraged, but the work you submit for assignments is expected to be entirely your own. That is, the writing and code must be yours, and you must fully understand everything that you submit. Discussing a paper or the details of how to solve a problem is fine, but you must write your submission yourself. Please list collaborators whom you discussed with in the assignment write-up. If we find highly identical work without proper accreditation of collaborators, we will take action according to university policies. For more, see the [CMU Academic Integrity Guidelines](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html).

## Late Policy
For the homework assignments only, students will be allowed a total of five late days per semester for personal emergencies. The late days are counted as days, not hours/mins (e.g., a one-hour overdue will be considered as a full late day). Any work submitted late after the five late days have been used will be given an automatic zero on the assignment. Make sure to start early and complete your assignments on time! Please note that the late days do not apply to any part of the final project. This policy will be enforced strictly.
